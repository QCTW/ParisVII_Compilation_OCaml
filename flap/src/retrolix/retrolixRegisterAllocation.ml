   The register allocation translates a Retrolix program into an
   equivalent Retrolix program that uses hardware registers as much as
   possible to hold intermediate results.

   Register allocation is done in two steps:

   - a static analysis called "Liveness Analysis of Variables" is
   performed to compute a graph. It approximates the interference
   relation of program variables, i.e. the intersection between the
   live ranges of variables. The nodes of the graph are the program
   variables and, in this graph, a node for 'x' and a node 'y' are
   connected iff 'x' and 'y' are in interference.

   - a graph coloring algorithm is executed on the interference graph:
   if two variables live at the same time, then their values cannot
   be carried by the same register ; thus, it suffices to use a different
   color for their nodes. Graph coloring is NP-complete. Yet, we will
   use a simple recursive algorithm that provides good results in
   practice.

      a conflict relation. *)

   To construct the interference graph:

   1. At any non-move instruction that defines variable a (where
   live-out variables are b1, ..., bj) add interference edges (a, b1),
   ..., (a, bj).

   2. At a move instruction a ‚Üê c (where variables b1, ..., bj are
   live-out) add interference edges (a, b1), ..., (a, bj) for any bi
   that is not the same as c.
